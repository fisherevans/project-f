## Context and Setting

### Personal Background

> Your history is not laid out explicitly. Through conversations and other hints, you find out about your life:

#### Childhood

You were born into a wealthy bureaucratic family in the inner rim. As you grew up, you had no interest in the politics and were mostly fascinated with exploration and the new life forms being discovered due to advancements in space travel.

Your mother died while you were young. It was unexpected and poorly documented. Those who know about it in detail refuse to share more than what is in the newspapers - they she suffered from an unexpected brain aneurysm.

You were sent through education programs that were only available to wealthy.

Before you finish your schooling, your father was assassinated. You wanted to just ignore the societal norms and stop trying to participate in politics and become a recluse. Your brother (your last remaining family member) thought the opposite and tried to take over the family's holdings. This drove a wedge between you two.

You fell into a deep depression and ran into debts as a result of escapism gambling.

Your brother refused to help you and offers no sympathy as he feels you already betrayed him by letting him deal with the fallout of Dad's death. You're debtor essentially forces into slave labor. You're shipped off to a remote moon colony to work in the mines to pay off your debt. You know that will never happen. Thankfully you're not used as a physical laborer, but as an engineer managing the equipment due to your partial education.

#### Life Anew

You essentially start life over, distancing yourself from your past.

While you hate your day-to-day life, and long to see nature and escape society, you still manage to make some strong friendships with others working the mine.

You often joke with your friends about escaping the mining colony with some habitation equipment to explore the asteroid ridden moon. But you never mean it. It's always a joke.

After a particularly gnarly tiff with your boss, warning him not to send people (including your friends) down to the mine due to an issue with life support, you end your shift and dope up to escape. During your high, you decide to say "fuck it" and actually do it. You go steal hibernation gear and sneak out.

You know deep down it's stupid and won't work, but you also know deep down you want to get caught, you want to die out there, you want to end this.

While hiding within a crater trying to setup camp, you feel the ground shake. With no atmosphere, you hear nothing, and see nothing. You can't leave the shadow of the creator without burning alive so you're forced to wait. Upon venturing out once again multiple sleep cycles later, you find an obliterated mining colony.

You immediately blame yourself. You know the life support issue couldn't have cause the explosion, but you convince yourself that your friends would have been alive if they had the proper, working equipment.

#### One Last Chance

You're picked up by a Thanadox surveying ship that was inspecting the wreckage and brought aboard. You assume they were just responding to a distress signal.

You explain your situation and background to them - but they find no records of you in the system. You assume the syndicate eradicated your records to ensure you never left the mining colony.

Due to your education and experience with the mining equipment, you're offered a position as an Astrobiologist, which is considered an undesirable job due to the isolation, risk of death, and use of untested technologies (Animechs). You take it as the only other option they give you is manual labor in the bowels of a colossal space ship in even worse conditions you were in before.

#### Revelations

You learn later on that:

- Your mother actually died as she was part of an experiment related to transferring a human soul - pre-animech technology
- Your father was assassinated by the activist cell you join later on
- Your brother's attempts to maintain the families holding seemed to fail. But in reality, he was forced to invest and support shadow organizations that were part of Thanadox Industries. He is furthering 
- Thanadox was actually behind the explosion. It wasn't intentional, the mining company had found the remains of a massive living organism in the core of the asteroid. Thanadox caught wind and came in to attempt to research it. In the process they somehow triggered a massive explosion by taking a gamble on trying to capture the Primortal essence of the being.
- The ship only picked you up to ensure know survivors knew of their involvement. Once they found out you thought it was due to faulty equipment, they thought it was best to keep you alive. It was only in their best interest, their original plan was to stick you out the airlock.

## Chapters

### Introduction

The game starts in a simulated environment, it is a training exercise put on by your new employer: Thanadox Industries.

- First, you are told to initiate the Imbuing process, where you enter a chair (like in the Matrix) and start the transition. Your soul is transferred to the Animech in the same room - and suddenly, you start controlling it. Your body remains still and no longer moves and does not interact.
- You're then told to explore a small environment requiring you to enter new rooms, turns on lights and open doors. Eventually you are locked in a room and a creature is let loose with you. You have to trigger an encounter with it and defeat it in battle.
- Once defeated, you are brought to a XenoCrypt, which you pick up. You're told to choose one of the specimens to attempt the capture. There are explanations for each one and must choose which room to enter.
- Once you enter and capture the Specimen, you then be instructed to pick up a canister of Elythium, which will meet the requirements to initiate the return transfer. (You're told that in a real scenario, you'll need much more to escape orbit).
- Using the checkpoint at the end of the intro biome, you initiate a return.
- Once your soul returns to your body, you're told to interact with the Animech control computer, which walks you through the process of creating a new Animetric Core, leveling up, and spending research points.
- After this, you're sent on your own ship and given a specific planet to explore and return captured Primortal back.
- You then begin the game loop of sending your Animech to a biome, capturing Primortals, and upgrading your build.
- Once you reach a set number of Primortals, you'll be given more research goals.

During this introduction, it's explained that the work you're be doing is important and for a good cause. Human expansion and exploitation is resulting in countless alien life forms to become extinct. Your goal is to document the life that exists on newly discovered planets, so that they can be preserved for future generations. The research of this special powers these Specimen have access to are also researched to further medicine and technologies.

### Cracks in the Facade

While exploring, you find evidence of nefarious acts done by the company
- You come across another Astrobiologist who is pessimistic and negative, though not hostile.
- You find flyers from activist groups in various checkpoints and outposts.
- Comments made by the snarky Astrobiologist and other NPCs align with and support the evidence

### Truth unveiled

- You find smoking gun evidence, maybe on a pirate ship? or decimated moon base?
- broken corporation tech and animechs found in in a civilian area that's been obliterated, news reports call it a terrorist attack
- They find out you know too much, make it clear they plan to "terminate" your contract

### Counter offensive

- The snark master brings you into the fold, and introduces you to an activist group
- In an attempt to save yourself, with help from the activists, you try to break into the corporations operations and wipe their database of yourself, so you can escape
- You're tasked with another ops mission to release all of the companies data to the public to make it accessible to everyone

### Exposing the truth

- You're betrayed in the final moments of your last mission, left stranded. The activist cell was using you and is actually after the info for their own benefit
- You find a way to still release the data, as well as proof of all the bad things both sides were doing.
- Both organization have to close up shop after the backlash
- you start an independent research network that makes all their research public and is transparent about their practices

## Additional Ideas

To incorporate...

- who is the player? have they been impacted by the loss of ecosystems? are they impacted directly by the corporations actions?
- Make the activist group have the same roots as the corporation - show the size creates greed and corruption. they turned itno nhilists as opposed to activists onc they felt helpless
