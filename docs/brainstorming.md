Just a scratch pad

Primortals have natures, that can be selected that alter base stats

Primortals also can unlock passive abilities that effect their skills - such as "reduce all skill lengths by 1 tick"



- When exploring, you will come across Specimen, which are agressive and fight you.
- You can choose to run away, defeat, or capture it.
  - To run away, attempt - chance to fail based on ratio of your level to the specimen.
  - To defeat, simply deplete its health with combat skills
  - To capture, need to XXXXXXX REDACTED - Resonance something or other?





- When capturing specimen, they can be of different natures. You need to capture the desired nature to unlock certain parts of the skill tree.

- 
- real time - or tempo based
  - if I did the time based method - what about abilities that trigger at the same time?
    - defence first, then attacks? speed is an rpg trait that break ties?
  - how do you let the player see what the opponent is doing - if we want other mechanics to affinities, to come into play

While in fight, holding select shows details:

- actual numbers for how much shld, sync, intg you have
- details about the selected skill:
  - ticks and damage pattern
  - damage dealt



I want QoL stuff, like what types an opponent is, to be hidden at first, but discovered over time, like by combat, or capturing.

I want new details to be remember, like, hitting a creature with a skill that's not very effective, some that type be remembered for the player while the full details are still being discovered?

I think the body type should be more easily figured out and shown - but the affinity(s) are more difficult to figure out
